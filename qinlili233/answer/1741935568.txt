“ 我 ”是与生俱来的还是后天形成的？
<p data-pid="CnHHRWTs">这不就是雅思剑9T4阅读第二篇嘛</p><blockquote data-pid="wHPjRYSq">Young children’s sense of identity<br><br>A A sense of self develops in young children by degrees.The process can usefully be thought of in terms of the gradual emergence of two somewhat separate features: the self as a subject, and the self as an object.William James introduced the distinction in 1892, and contemporaries of his, such as Charles Cooley, added to the developing debate.Ever since then psychologists have continued building on the theory.<br><br>孩子的自我认知是渐渐形成的。在这一过程中会逐渐形成稍有不同的两种特征：主体自我和客体自我。1892年William James提出了两者的区别，而与他同一时代的人，如Charles Cooley等，也加人到这场愈加壮大的辩论中。从此，心理学家在此基础上不断发展自我认知理论。<br><br>B According to James, a child’s first step on the road to self-understanding can be seen as the recognition that he or she exists.This is an aspect of the self that he labelled 'self-as-subject’, and he gave it various elements.These included an awareness of one’s own agency (i.e.one's power to act), and an awareness of one's distinctiveness from other people.These features gradually emerge as infants explore their world and interact with caregivers.Cooley (1902) suggested that a sense of the self-as-subject was primarily concerned with being able to exercise power.He proposed that the earliest examples of this are an infant's attempts to control physical objects, such as toys or his or her own limbs.This is followed by attempts to affect the behaviour of other people.For example, infants learn that when they cry or smile someone responds to them.<br><br>根据James的观点，一个孩子自我认知之路的第一步可被视为意识到自己的存在。这就是他称之为“主体自我”的一个方面，他还解释了构成主体自我的众多因素。其中包括对自我权力（即行动权力)和自我独特性的认识。当婴儿探索世界并与照顾他的人进行互动时，这些特征会渐渐显现。Cooley (1902年)认 为主体自我的意识主要与实施权力的能力有关。他提出，婴儿试图控制实物，比如玩具或者自己的胳膊和腿，就是表现主体自我意识的最早的例子。接着，婴儿会试图影响其他人的行为。比如他们知道当他们哭泣或微笑时就有人会回应他们。<br><br>C Another powerful source of information for infants about the effects they can have on the world around them is provided when others mimic them.Many parents spend a lot of time, particularly in the early months, copying their infants vocalizations and <a href="http://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//expressions.In" class=" external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><span class="invisible">http://</span><span class="visible">expressions.In</span><span class="invisible"></span></a> addition, young children enjoy looking in mirrors, where the movements they can see are dependent upon their own movements.This is not to say that infants recognize the reflection as their own image (a later development).However, Lewis and Brooks-Gunn (1979) suggest that infants’ developing understanding that the movements they see in the mirror are contingent on their own, leads to a growing awareness that they are distinct from other people.This is because they; and only they, can change the reflection in the mirror.<br><br>他人对婴儿的模仿是婴儿的又一个强大信息源，让他们了解到他们对周围世界所能产生的影响。许多父母花大量的时间模仿孩子的发音和表情，尤其是在婴儿出生后的前几个月。此外，婴幼儿很喜欢照镜子，因为他们能看到的镜子中的动作完全取决于他们自己的动作。这并不是说婴儿已经意识到镜子里的人就是他们自己(这是后面的发展阶段)。但是，Lewis和Brooks-Gunn (1979年)认为婴儿认识到镜子里的动作取决于他们自己的动作，这一理解的发展促使婴儿逐渐意识到自己与他人不同。因为正是他们、也只有他们才能改变镜子里的影像。<br><br>D This understanding that children gain of themselves as active agents continues to develop in their attempts to co-operate with others in play.Dunn (1988) points out that it is in such day-to-day relationships and interactions that the child's understanding of his- or herself emerges.Empirical investigations of the self-as-subject in young children are, however, rather scarce because of difficulties of communication: even if young infants can reflect on their experience, they certainly cannot express this aspect of the self directly.<br><br>孩子认识到自己具有主动的权力，他们获得的这种认识通过在游戏中与他人合作得到发展。Dunn (1988年)指出，正是在这样的日常关系和互动中，孩子对于自身的认识才得以出现。然而，在幼儿中进行的关于主体自我的实证调查还相当不足，其原因在于交流上的困难：即使婴儿可以回想起自身的经历，他们也肯定还无法直接表达自我的这一方面。<br><br>E Once children have acquired a certain level of self-awareness, they begin to place themselves in a whole series of categories/ which together play such an important part in defining them uniquely as 'themselves'.This second step in the development of a full sense of self is what James called the 'self-as-object'.This has been seen by many to be the aspect of the self which is most influenced by social elements, since it is made up of social roles (such as student, brother, colleague) and characteristics which derive their meaning from comparison or interaction with other people (such as trustworthiness, shyness, sporting ability).<br><br>—旦孩子获得了一定程度上的自我认知，他们便开始将自己置于整个一系列的范畴之中，而这一系列范畴在定义他们为独特的“自己”的过程中共同发挥了重要作用。这就是完整自我认知发展过程中的第二步，即James所谓的“客体自我”认知。很多人认为这一自我认知受社会因素影响最大，因为客体自我由社会角色构成(比如学生、兄弟、同事)并包含一些来自与他人比较或互动而产生的性格特点(比如可信、羞怯、善于运动)。<br><br>F Cooley and other researchers suggested a close connection between a person’s own understanding of their identity and other people's understanding of it.Cooley believed that people build up their sense of identity from the reactions of others to them, and from the view they believe others have of them.He called the self-as-object the 'looking-glass self’, since people come to see themselves as they are reflected in others.Mead (1934) went even further, and saw the self and the social world as inextricably bound together: ‘The self is essentially a social structure, and it arises in social experience ... it is impossible to conceive of a self arising outside of social experience.'<br><br>Cooley和其他研究人员认为，一个人对其身份的自我认知与他人对此的认知之间存在密切联系。Cooley相信，人们的自我认知建立在他人对自己的反应，以及他们认为别人对自己所持的观点的基础之上。他将客体自我称为“镜中自我”，因为人们也从他人的眼中认识自己。Mead (1934年)在此研究基础上作了更为深人的探究，他认为个人和社会是密不可分的：“从根本上说，个人是社会结构的组成部分，并在社会经验中成长……根本无法设想一个人的成长可以脱离社会经验。"<br><br>G Lewis and Brooks-Gunn argued that an important developmental milestone is reached when children become able to recognize themselves visually without the support of seeing contingent movement.This recognition occurs around their second <a href="http://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//birthday.In" class=" external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><span class="invisible">http://</span><span class="visible">birthday.In</span><span class="invisible"></span></a> one experiment Lewis and Brooks-Gunn (1979) dabbed some red powder on the noses of children who were playing in front of a mirror, and then observed how often they touched their noses.The psychologists reasoned that if the children knew what they usually looked like, they would be surprised by the unusual red mark and would start touching it.On the other hand/ they found that children of 15 to 18 months are generally not able to recognize themselves unless other cues such as movement are present.<br><br>Lewis和Brooks-Gunn争辩道，当孩子变得无需借助于观察跟随自己移动的物体就能从视觉上辨认出自己时，便达到了自我认知发展过程中一个重要的里程碑。这一自我认知通常发生在大约两岁的时候。在一项实验中，Lewis和Brooks-Gunn (1979年)将在镜子前玩耍的孩子的鼻尖轻轻涂上红粉，然后观察他们多久摸一次自己的鼻子。心理学家推断，如果孩子了解自己平时的样子，他们会对鼻尖上不常见的红印感到惊讶，并会开始摸鼻子。另一方面，研究者发现15〜18个月大的孩子一般不能辨认出自己，除非向他们呈现其他提示如运动。<br><br>H Finally, perhaps the most graphic expressions of self-awareness in general can be seen in the displays of rage which are most common from 18 months to 3 years of <a href="http://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//age.In" class=" external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><span class="invisible">http://</span><span class="visible">age.In</span><span class="invisible"></span></a> a longitudinal study of groups of three or four children, Bronson (1975) found that the intensity of the frustration and anger in their disagreements increased sharply between the ages of 1 and 2 years.Often, the children's disagreements involved a struggle over a toy that none of them had played with before or after the tug-of-war: the children seemed to be disputing ownership rather than wanting to play with it.Although it may be less marked in other societies, the link between the sense of 'self' and of 'ownership' is a notable feature of childhood in Western societies.<br><br>最后，一般的自我认知最形象的表达方式大概就是愤怒，这在18个月到3岁的孩子身上最为常见。在对每组三四个孩子的纵向研究中，Bronson (1975年)发现1〜2岁的孩子在争论中产生的挫败感和愤怒的强度急剧增加。通常，孩子们的这种争论会涉及激烈争夺以前都没玩过的一个玩具之前或之后的冲突：孩子们似乎在争抢玩具的拥有权而非真的想玩玩具。尽管这点在其他社会中也许并不是这么明显，但是在西方社会，对“自我”和“所有权”的认知之间的联系在儿童时期是非常明显的特点。</blockquote>
