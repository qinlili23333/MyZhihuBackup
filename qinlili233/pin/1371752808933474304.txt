似乎下赛道的专业车手也会抱怨特斯拉的abs介入太诡异了。（特斯拉的赛道模式会停用esp和tcs，但不会停用abs）&#34;When you&#39;re straight and balanced, the car stops extremely well with a hard attack of the pedal,&#34; Randy says. &#34;But in a corner or over a bump, I want to lay into it softly so as not to instigate the ABS. When the car is lightly loaded [cresting a bump], there&#39;s more ABS intervention than with the supercars we sometimes drive here. After talking to the engineers, I started braking after the first bump and straightened out my line in the brake zone so I didn&#39;t have much cornering load, which helped a lot.&#34; Although the Model 3 doesn&#39;t feel as heavy as it actually is, nevertheless, the weight of a battery-electric car invites this sort of ABS moments as it heaves over undulations.
